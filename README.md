## Documentation

#### [View the Documentation â†’](https://github.com/JSBros/hedron/wiki/Grid-System)

## Example Usage

[View interactive example on webpackbin](http://www.webpackbin.com/V1zqQ_gZf)

``` jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Page, Row, Column } from 'hedron';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Page>
        <Row>
          <Column sm={8} smShift={2} lg={6} lgShift={3}>
            <h1>This is a column that's centered using the shift props</h1>
          </Column>
        </Row>
        <Row>
          <Column fluid sm={4}>
            <h1>Fluid Columns</h1>
          </Column>
          <Column fluid sm={4}>
            <p>It's a 12 column layout by default.</p>
          </Column>
          <Column fluid sm={4}>
            <Row divisions={24}>
              <Column sm={24}>
                <p>
                  But you can change the amount of columns by adding the
                  `divisions` property to a Row.
                </p>
                <p>It's fully embeddable as well!</p>
              </Column>
            </Row>
          </Column>
        </Row>
      </Page>
    );
  };
}
```

## Contributing

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to hedron. If you're wanting to make a contribution and not sure what to do, take a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/JSBros/hedron/issues) and look at the tasks labeled with `help wanted`.

### Building the module from source

    $ git clone https://github.com/JSBros/hedron

To install all dependencies, you can use either npm or yarn. I personally prefer [and recommend] using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

#### npm

    $ npm install

#### yarn

    $ yarn install

#### Building

To build hedron from the source code, please run the following command inside the hedron directory

    $ npm run build

Before you submit a pull request, you must first make sure that the code base is passing eslint inspections. To do that, please run the following

    $ npm run lint

If all goes well, nothing spectacular should happen. If there are any errors, you'll get a lot of red output in your terminal and it will list exactly what needs to be fixed.
